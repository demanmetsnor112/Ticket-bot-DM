  <strong><i>A feature-rich ticket bot for Discord.</i></strong>

## What is this?

this is similar to Reddit's, both in functionality and purpose. It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users in a seamless way.

This bot is free for everyone and always will be. If you like this project and would like to show your appreciation, you can support us on **[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/kyber)**, cool benefits included! 

## How does it work?

When a member sends a direct message to the bot, this will create a channel or "thread" into a designated category. All further DM messages will automatically relay to that channel; any available staff can respond within the channel.

Our Logviewer will save the threads so you can view previous threads through their corresponding log link. Here is an [**example**](https://logs.modmail.dev/example).

## Features

* **Highly Customisable:**
  * Bot activity, prefix, category, log channel, etc.
  * Command permission system.
  * Interface elements (color, responses, reactions, etc.).
  * Snippets and *command aliases*.
  * Minimum duration for accounts to be created before allowed to contact this (`account_age`).
  * Minimum length for members to be in the guild before allowed to contact this (`guild_age`). 

* **Advanced Logging Functionality:**
  * When you close a thread, this will generate a [log link](https://logs.modmail.dev/example) and post it to your log channel.
  * Native Discord dark-mode feel.
  * Markdown/formatting support.
  * Login via Discord to protect your logs ([premium Patreon feature](https://patreon.com/kyber)).
  * See past logs of a user with `?logs`.
  * Searchable by text queries using `?logs search`.

* **Robust implementation:**
  * Schedule tasks in human time, e.g. `?close in 2 hours silently`.
  * Editing and deleting messages are synced.
  * Support for the diverse range of message contents (multiple images, files).
  * Paginated commands interfaces via reactions.

This list is ever-growing thanks to active development and our exceptional contributors. See a full list of documented commands by using the `?help` command.

## Installation

Where can I find the this bot invite link? 

Unfortunately, due to how this bot functions, it cannot be invited. The lack of an invite link is to ensure an individuality to your server and grant you full control over your bot and data.
